# `viva-gige` — GigE Vision transport (GVCP/GVSP)

`viva-gige` implements the GigE Vision transport on Windows, Linux and macOS:
discovery and control over **GVCP**, image data over **GVSP**, plus interface
enumeration, event and action messages, and device-timestamp mapping.

It sits below `viva-genapi` — this crate moves bytes, the NodeMap decides which
bytes. Applications normally reach it through `viva-genicam`.

## Selecting the local interface

On a multi-NIC host, bind to the NIC that reaches the camera. `Iface` offers
four ways to get one, and the difference between them has caused real bugs:

```rust,ignore
use viva_gige::nic::Iface;

Iface::from_system("eth0")?;                  // by interface name
Iface::from_ipv4("192.168.0.5".parse()?)?;    // by *host* address
Iface::from_remote_ipv4("192.168.0.10".parse()?)?; // by the *camera's* address
Iface::list()?;                               // everything the library can see
```

`from_ipv4` takes an address **on this host**. `from_remote_ipv4` takes the
camera's address and probes the routing table for the interface that reaches
it — which is what you want when all you have is the camera's IP. Passing a
camera address to `from_ipv4` is the defect that made acquisition fail on real
hardware in [#70](https://github.com/VitalyVorobyev/viva-genicam/issues/70): it
only ever worked against the loopback fake, where the two addresses coincide.

`Iface::list()` is also a diagnostic. It reports interfaces *as the library sees
them*, which is not always the set the OS shows — on Windows, link-local
`169.254.x.x` addresses were invisible until the `link-local` feature of
`if-addrs` was enabled, and an interface missing from this list is invisible to
discovery no matter what `ipconfig` says
([#57](https://github.com/VitalyVorobyev/viva-genicam/issues/57)).

## Discovery (GVCP)

A broadcast command, then replies collected for a timeout window. Each reply
becomes a `DeviceInfo` with IP, MAC, manufacturer, model, version, serial and
user-defined name.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../crates/viva-genicam/examples/list_cameras.rs:discover}}
```

| Function | Scans |
|---|---|
| `discover(timeout)` | Every routable interface |
| `discover_on_interface(timeout, name)` | One named interface |
| `discover_all(timeout)` | Every interface **including loopback** |

Use `discover_all` only for the [fake camera](../tutorials/fake-camera.md).
One unusable interface no longer aborts the whole call, and a stray non-GVCP
packet on the port no longer discards the replies already collected — both were
real failure modes.

From the CLI:

```bash
cargo run -p viva-camctl -- list --iface 192.168.0.5
```

---

## Control (GVCP)

`GigeDevice` owns one control channel:

```rust,ignore
use viva_gige::gvcp::{GigeDevice, GVCP_PORT};

let mut device = GigeDevice::open(SocketAddr::new(camera_ip.into(), GVCP_PORT)).await?;
device.claim_control().await?;

let value = device.read_register(0x0a00).await?;
device.write_register(0x0a00, value | 1).await?;

let bytes = device.read_mem(0x0200, 512).await?;
```

`read_register`/`write_register` are 32-bit at a 32-bit address;
`read_mem`/`write_mem` take a 64-bit address and a length, and chunk the
transfer to fit the transport.

### Control privilege and the heartbeat

`claim_control()` takes the Control Channel Privilege. A device **revokes it**
if no GVCP command arrives within `GevHeartbeatTimeout` — 3 000 ms is typical —
and GVSP image traffic does not count towards that timer. A camera can therefore
be streaming at full rate while the control channel times out, and the next
write fails with `AccessDenied`.

You do not have to manage this. `GigeRegisterIo` in `viva-genicam` owns a
keepalive: it reads the device's own `GevHeartbeatTimeout` and pings at a
quarter of it, so holding a `Camera` is enough. `heartbeat_timeout_ms()` and
`ping_control_channel()` are here for anyone driving `GigeDevice` directly.

### IP configuration

`force_ip` assigns a temporary address to a camera identified by MAC — useful
when a camera is on the wrong subnet and otherwise unreachable.
`write_persistent_ip` and `enable_persistent_ip` make it survive a power cycle.

```bash
cargo run -p viva-camctl -- set-ip --mac DE:AD:BE:EF:CA:FE --ip 192.168.1.100 --force
```

---

## Events and actions

- **Events** are device-to-host notifications on the message channel (exposure
  end, and vendor-defined ones). `set_message_destination` points the device at
  a host socket; `viva_genicam::EventStream` presents the result.
- **Actions** are host-to-many-devices: `send_action` broadcasts an action
  command so several cameras trigger together, optionally at a scheduled
  timestamp. `AckSummary` reports which devices acknowledged.

Both are vendor-variable. If you schedule actions, keep the time bases
consistent — see `TimeSync` below.

---

## Streaming (GVSP)

The receiver negotiates stream parameters on the control channel, then receives
UDP packets and reassembles frames by block ID.

Application code builds streams through `viva-genicam`, not this crate
directly:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../crates/viva-genicam/examples/grab_gige.rs:stream}}
```

`StreamBuilder` (in `viva_genicam::stream`) exposes `iface`, `dest`,
`target_mtu`, `packet_size`, `packet_delay`,
`destination_port`, `multicast`, `rcvbuf_bytes` and `channel`. `FrameStream`
wraps the result and yields whole frames.

### Packet size and MTU

`GevSCPSPacketSize` is the size of the transmitted **IP packet**, so it must fit
the path MTU end to end. The probed MTU is used unless `packet_size` overrides
it. Two caveats
worth knowing:

- Cameras **clamp** a size they cannot honour, and the write succeeds when they
  do. `StreamBuilder::build` reads the register back through
  `GigeDevice::get_stream_packet_size` and puts the *effective* size in
  `StreamParams`, so reassembly follows the camera rather than the request. A
  device that will not answer the read-back keeps the requested value and logs
  a warning.
- On a large-MTU link the requested size must still be clamped to the IPv4
  maximum. Linux loopback reports MTU 65536, which would produce a
  65 508-byte datagram against the 65 507-byte limit — every `send_to` fails.
  An explicitly configured size above 65 535 is refused rather than truncated:
  `GevSCPSPacketSize` holds the size in 16 bits, so writing 70 000 would
  configure 4 464.

### Resend

GVSP defines packet resend, and the pieces exist here — `ResendPlanner`,
`coalesce_missing`, `GigeDevice::request_resend`. **They are not wired into the
receive path** (backlog SR-04). Nothing in a live stream requests a resend, and
nothing increments the `resends` counter, so a summary reading `resends=0` means
"not implemented" rather than "none were needed". `drops` is the number to
watch. This section changes when resend lands.

### Chunk data

With `ChunkModeActive` set, the payload carries the image followed by chunk
blocks (`[id][reserved][length][data]`). `parse_chunks` extracts them and skips
what it does not recognise; `viva_genicam::ChunkMap` maps the known ones
(timestamp, exposure, gain) to typed values.

### Statistics

`StreamStats` carries `frames`, `bytes`, `drops`, `packets`, `avg_fps`,
`avg_mbps`, `avg_latency_ms` and the elapsed window. The resend and
backpressure counters are inert for the reason above.

---

## Timestamp mapping

Devices report a tick counter, not wall-clock time. `TimeSync` maintains a
linear mapping from device ticks to host `SystemTime`, calibrated by latching
the device timestamp against a host reading. Without that calibration there is
no origin to map from — so treat an uncalibrated host timestamp as absent
rather than as data.

---

## Logging

```bash
RUST_LOG=info,viva_gige=debug cargo run -p viva-camctl -- stream --ip 192.168.0.10
```

`viva-camctl` maps `-v` to `debug` and `-vv` to `trace` if you would rather not
set the variable. Useful targets: `viva_gige::gvcp` (binds, discovery, register
ops), `viva_gige::gvsp` (packets, reassembly, frame stats), `viva_gige::nic`
(interface enumeration and socket binding).

## Platform notes

**Windows.** Allow inbound UDP for discovery and the stream port, for both the
Private and Public firewall profiles. Enable jumbo frames in the NIC's advanced
settings if the whole path supports them, and keep the power plan on high
performance — receive buffers default low on many desktop NICs.

**Linux.** With firewalld, GVCP replies arrive from source port 3956 and the
GVSP port needs its own rule — see
[Link-local (APIPA) cameras](../networking.md#3-link-local-apipa-cameras).
`net.core.rmem_max` caps how far `rcvbuf_bytes` can go.

**Link-local.** GigE Vision cameras fall back to `169.254.0.0/16` when no DHCP
server answers. That works, but the host needs an address in the same range and
the firewall usually needs telling — the same networking chapter covers it.
