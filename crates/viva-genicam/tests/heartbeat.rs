//! The control channel survives an idle period (SR-05).
//!
//! A GigE Vision device revokes control privilege if it receives no GVCP command
//! within `GevHeartbeatTimeout`, and GVSP image traffic does not count. Before
//! SR-05 the library did none of this: `connect_gige` claimed privilege and
//! nothing refreshed it, so an idle session — a Python prompt, a stream running
//! with no register access — silently lost control and the next write failed.
//! Three consumers had each grown their own copy of the same loop; the library
//! owns it now.
//!
//! These two tests are a pair. The negative control proves the fake camera
//! really does expire privilege, so the positive test cannot pass by the fake
//! being permissive.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test -p viva-genicam --test heartbeat
//! ```
