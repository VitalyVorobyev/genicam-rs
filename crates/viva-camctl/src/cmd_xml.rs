//! `viva-camctl xml` — dump a camera's GenApi XML.
//!
//! Every camera-specific bug found so far was diagnosed from the reporter's
//! own XML, and until now the library offered no supported way to produce one:
//! the fetch existed but only behind [`common::open_camera`], which builds a
//! nodemap first. That is exactly the step that fails on the cameras whose XML
//! we most need — the reporter of issue #45 was told camctl could dump it,
//! could not, and had to supply four other models instead.
//!
//! So this command stops at the fetch. Nothing is parsed, so nothing about the
//! document's contents can make it fail.
