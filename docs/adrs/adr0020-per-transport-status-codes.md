# ADR-0020: Per-Transport Status Codes over a Shared Table

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2026-07-30

## Context

`viva-gencp` defines one `StatusCode` enum, and both transports decode
their acknowledgement status through it: `viva-gige` (GVCP) via
`GigeError::Status`, and `viva-u3v` (GenCP over USB) via `decode_ack`.
The enum has six named variants plus `Unknown(u16)`.

Three of those six are wrong, and the shape of the enum is why the errors
went unnoticed for so long.

**The immediate defect.** A user on [#45] wrote an exposure value to a
FLIR BFS-PGE-31S4C and got:

```
io error: device reported status Unknown(32774)
```

`32774` is `0x8006`, `ACCESS_DENIED`. Checking the table against Wireshark's
GVCP dissector (`epan/dissectors/packet-gvcp.c:204-229`) and aravis
(`arvgvcpprivate.h`, `arvuvcpprivate.h`) — two implementations that agree
with each other completely — found:

| raw | our name | actual |
|---|---|---|
| 0x8004 | `DeviceBusy` | `WRITE_PROTECT` |
| 0x8005 | `Error` | `BAD_ALIGNMENT` |
| 0x8006 | *(none)* | `ACCESS_DENIED` |
| 0x8007 | *(none)* | `BUSY` |
| 0x8FFF | *(none)* | `ERROR` (the generic one) |

So a write to a write-protected register reports "device busy", and the
generic error — the one a device sends when it has nothing more specific —
has no name at all.

**Why adding rows is not enough.** The two tables are not the same table.
They share `0x0000`, `0x8001`–`0x8007` and `0x8FFF`, and then diverge:

- GVCP owns the packet-resend family: `0x0100` `PACKET_RESEND`, and
  `0x800C`–`0x8017` (`PACKET_UNAVAILABLE`, `DATA_OVERRUN`,
  `PACKET_NOT_YET_AVAILABLE`, `NO_REF_TIME`, `OVERFLOW`, `ACTION_LATE`,
  `LEADER_TRAILER_OVERFLOW`, …).
- GenCP owns `0xA001`–`0xA101` (`RESEND_NOT_SUPPORTED`,
  `DSI_ENDPOINT_HALTED`, `SI_PAYLOAD_SIZE_NOT_ALIGNED`,
  `SI_REGISTERS_INCONSISTENT`, `DATA_DISCARDED`, `DATA_OVERRUN`).

And they **conflict at the same code**:

| raw | GVCP | GenCP |
|---|---|---|
| `0x800B` | `NO_MSG` (deprecated) | `MSG_TIMEOUT` |

A single flat enum cannot decode `0x800B` correctly for both transports, so
no amount of added variants fixes it. This is the decision-forcing fact.

**What the shared table already cost us.** `viva-u3v` needed to recognise
GenCP's pending-acknowledge, found no variant for it, and reached for
`StatusCode::Unknown(0x8006)` (`control.rs:29`, `:189`) — attaching the
meaning "device needs more time" to what is really `ACCESS_DENIED`. The
belief was then recorded in the backlog as settled (TC-01: "U3V signals the
same condition with status `0x8006`, so the two transports do not share a
representation") and asserted in a unit test (`control.rs:472`).

Pending-acknowledge is not a status in either protocol. GVCP models it as
an opcode (`0x0089`) and we already had that right. GenCP models it the
same way, as command id `0x0805`. The consequences of the misreading:

- A genuine `ACCESS_DENIED` on U3V is slept-and-retried 100 times
  (`MAX_PENDING_RETRIES`) and then reported as `Timeout`.
- A genuine pending-ack is never detected as one. Worse, `decode_ack`
  discards the acknowledgement's command id (`let _opcode`, `:267`) and
  `transact` validates only the request id, so the pending-ack is accepted
  as the real answer and its `time_to_completion` SCD is returned **as the
  register value**. A 4-byte read gets a plausible wrong number.

That is the fourth occurrence of the pattern ADR-0019 names: a fake or a
test encoding the client's own wrong assumption, so the round trip proves
nothing.

## Decision

**Give each transport its own status type, over a shared core.**

1. `viva-gencp` keeps a `StatusCode` for the codes the two protocols
   genuinely share (`0x0000`, `0x8001`–`0x8007`, `0x8FFF`), with the
   corrected meanings. It gains no transport-specific variant.
2. `viva-gige` and `viva-u3v` each own an enum that wraps the shared core
   and adds its own range. Decoding is per transport, so `0x800B` resolves
   correctly on both.
3. Every status type carries a `Display` that prints **the name and the raw
   hex together**. `Unknown(32774)` is what sent a user to the issue
   tracker; `ACCESS_DENIED (0x8006)` would not have. Unknown codes print as
   hex, never bare decimal.
4. Pending-acknowledge is modelled as a **command id** in both transports,
   never as a status. `viva-u3v`'s `decode_ack` surfaces the command id,
   and `transact` requires it to equal `OpCode::ack_code()` before
   accepting a payload — the check aravis makes at
   `arvuvdevice.c:344-373`.
5. Fixtures are spec-derived per ADR-0019: literal byte arrays for each
   acknowledgement shape, asserted independently of our own encoder.

**Evidence standing.** The tables above come from two corroborating
implementations plus one hardware data point (#45's `0x8006`), *not* from
the specification text, which we do not have locally. Per the evidence
hierarchy that is strong enough to correct a clear defect and to choose the
structure, but the individual code meanings must be checked against GigE
Vision §18.4 and the GenCP status table before this ADR moves to Accepted.

### What is implemented so far

This ADR is **Proposed**, and the decision above is deliberately larger than
the change that introduces it. Landed now:

- Points 3 (`Display` with name and hex), 4 (pending-ack as a command id,
  with the acknowledgement's command validated against
  `OpCode::ack_code()`) and 5 (a literal `SPEC_STATUS_TABLE` fixture,
  independent of `to_raw`).
- The shared `StatusCode` corrected: `WriteProtect`, `BadAlignment`,
  `AccessDenied`, `Busy` and `GenericError` added; `DeviceBusy` and the
  catch-all `Error` removed. `is_retryable()` added, which fixed a third
  consequence of the mislabelling — GVCP's retry loop matched the old
  `DeviceBusy` (`0x8004`), so it retried `WRITE_PROTECT`, a refusal no
  retry can satisfy, and returned immediately on `0x8007 BUSY`, the one
  status where retrying is the right answer.

Still to do, tracked as **TC-16**:

- Points 1 and 2, the per-transport wrapper types. Until they exist, a
  transport-specific code decodes as `Unknown(raw)` — correct and
  reportable, just not named. `0x800B` is the case that forces the split,
  and no code path we have decodes it today, which is why the structural
  work can follow the correctness fix rather than block it.

Splitting this way keeps the change that fixes a user-visible defect small
enough to review against the tables, and leaves the API break for the
0.4.0 consolidation window where API-02 and API-03 already live.

## Consequences

### Positive

- `0x800B` becomes decodable at all, and three mislabelled codes start
  telling the truth. A write-protected register stops reporting "busy".
- Device errors become readable without a hex converter, which is the
  difference between a user filing a useful report and filing
  `Unknown(32774)`.
- The U3V control channel stops returning pending-ack timeout bytes as
  register data — a silent-wrong-data path closes.
- The layering matches the protocols: `viva-gencp` holds what GenCP and
  GVCP actually share, and neither transport is forced to borrow the
  other's vocabulary. The pressure that produced the `0x8006` misreading
  is gone rather than patched.

### Negative

- Breaking change to a published API. `StatusCode` is `pub` in
  `viva-gencp` and appears in `GigeError::Status` and `U3vError::Status`.
  Acceptable at this stage (CLAUDE.md: no backward-compatibility promise
  before 1.0), and it lands with the 0.3.1/0.4.0 window rather than
  mid-cycle.
- Three types instead of one, and a conversion at each transport boundary.
  The alternative — one enum plus a transport discriminant threaded through
  every decode — puts the same branching in a worse place.
- `Unknown(u16)` must stay on all three. Devices send codes no table lists,
  and refusing to represent them would turn a readable error into a parse
  failure.
